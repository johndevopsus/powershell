# Define the directory where Jenkins job config files are located
$jenkinsConfigDir = "C:\Path\To\Your\Jenkins\Config\Directory"

# Define the string you want to search for
$searchString = "YourStringHere"

# Get all Jenkins job config files within the directory
$jenkinsConfigs = Get-ChildItem -Path $jenkinsConfigDir -Filter "config.xml"

# Loop through each config file and search for lines starting with the specified string
foreach ($configFile in $jenkinsConfigs) {
    $content = Get-Content -Path $configFile.FullName
    foreach ($line in $content) {
        if ($line -match "^$searchString") {
            Write-Output "Match found in $($configFile.FullName): $line"
        }
    }
}



You can use PowerShell to search for lines starting with a given string in all Jenkins job configuration files within a directory. Hereâ€™s a sample script to do that:

# Define the directory where Jenkins job config files are located
$jenkinsConfigDir = "C:\Path\To\Your\Jenkins\Config\Directory"

# Define the string you want to search for
$searchString = "YourStringHere"

# Get all Jenkins job config files within the directory
$jenkinsConfigs = Get-ChildItem -Path $jenkinsConfigDir -Filter "config.xml" -Recurse

# Loop through each config file and search for the specified string
foreach ($configFile in $jenkinsConfigs) {
    $content = Get-Content -Path $configFile.FullName
    foreach ($line in $content) {
        if ($line -like "$searchString*") {
            Write-Output "Match found in $($configFile.FullName): $line"
        }
    }
}

Replace "C:\Path\To\Your\Jenkins\Config\Directory" with the actual path to your Jenkins job configuration files directory and "YourStringHere" with the string you want to search for.

This script will recursively search for all config.xml files within the specified directory and its subdirectories. If a line in any of these files starts with the specified string, it will print out the file name and the matching line.
